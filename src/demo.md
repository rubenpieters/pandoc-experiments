My changes

*These rules are compatible with cards from the game ANDROID: NETRUNNER by Fantasy Flight Games. ANDROID: NETRUNNER is a game about the cyber-struggle between massive Corporations and subversive hackers known as Runners.*

##### The game is played between two players. One player takes the role of the Corp (Corporation) and the other takes the role of the Runner. This rules document will frequently refer to a player interchangeably with their game role.

##### Each player needs a legal deck, an identity card for their role, and any extra cards used from outside their deck. They also need a supply of tokens as described in section 1.9. The constraints that define the legality of a deck are defined in @sec:sec_deck_construction, and the cases where cards outside the deck and identity can be used are defined in section 1.5.

## The Golden Rules {#sec:sec_golden_rules}

1. If the text of a card directly contradicts these rules, the text of the card takes precedence.
2. If a rule or ability directs something to happen, but another effect states that it cannot happen, the “cannot” ability takes precedence.
  a. If a “cannot” effect prohibits all of the effects of another ability, that ability cannot be triggered.
  b. If a “cannot” effect prohibits only part of another ability, that ability can be triggered, but the prohibited steps of resolving that ability are not carried out.
3. If an instruction includes the words “if able,” it can only be carried out fully or not at all. If any part of the instruction is not possible to carry out, the entire instruction is ignored.
